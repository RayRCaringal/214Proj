TestCaseA()
    -We will compare the speed (Elapsed Time), of Processes, Sequnetial Search, and Threads by running tests in intervals of 250 as
    250 is the MAX size of each subarray. We are limiting the max subarray to 150 giving us a MAX Array Size of 37,500. 

    -Test Case A starts at Array Size 250 and incremenets Array Size by 250 until we reach MAX Array size of 37,500. This leaves us with
    150 sub arrays. 

    -Each Subarray looks for values in intervals of 50, so the amount of times each search is run for threads or processes is 
    ArraySize/50.

    -We take the average of the Total Run Time for each method and divide it by ArraySize to get the average run time. 

    -Each subarray is scrambled after all methods have succeded. 

    -This will allow us to see how fast Sequnetial Search is across Multithreading and Multiprocessing at smaller array sizes
    and larger array sizes

TestCaseB()
    -TestCaseB is TestCaseA() except we do not choose our value in an orderly manner, instead we randomize the value. This accounts
    for the problem we face with scramble, as we only scramble all elements in the beginning. This can theoretically effect run time
    so by randomizing the value searched and taking the average we can compare it to the graph and run time of TestCaseA to ensure
    accuracy.
